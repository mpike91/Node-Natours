# Node - Natours

This server-side rendered application utilizes a custom-built API connected to a MongoDB database. I picked up many skills and tools in creating this app, including Node.js, MongoDB, MongoDB Compass, Mongoose, Postman, server-side rendering using templates, and a host of backend development skills.

The app itself emulates an outdoors trip booking company, where users can view trips, log in, update profile, book tours, review tours, pay for tours, and more.

## My Contribution

In creating this app, I followed along with the Udemy course "Jonas Schmedtman's Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2023." All styling via CSS was provided, but I wrote all the backend code as I followed the course materials.
